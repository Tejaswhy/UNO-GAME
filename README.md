# UNO-GAME
This is my first project, a 2-player UNO game where a human plays against the computer. I developed it in C++ using random shuffling, stacks, arrays, and pointers for gameplay mechanics. The computer plays with basic logic, making the game interactive. Iâ€™ll fix any errors soon, and feedback is always welcome
